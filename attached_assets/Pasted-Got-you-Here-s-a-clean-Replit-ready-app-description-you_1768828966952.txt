App Description (for Replit / vibe coding)

Expense IQ is a smart, student-focused expense tracking web app designed to help college students understand where their money goes, why they overspend, and how to fix it.

Unlike basic expense trackers that only show numbers, Expense IQ focuses on behavioral insights. It tracks daily spending, categorizes expenses automatically, identifies impulsive or unnecessary purchases, and provides simple, actionable suggestions to improve money habits.

The app supports:

Automatic expense input via UPI transaction history (simulated for now)

Manual expense entry for cash or non-UPI payments

Clean dashboards with visual charts

Student-friendly insights instead of financial jargon

Expense IQ is built as a web application first, optimized for both mobile and laptop screens, and can later scale to a full mobile app.
